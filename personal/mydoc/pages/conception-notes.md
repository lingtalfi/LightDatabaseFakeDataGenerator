Generate fake data for your database quickly.





Column generator
--------
2021-07-02


A **column generator** generates the value for a particular column.



A column generator can be:

- a special string amongst the followings:
     - not implemented yet

- a string, in which case the string will be inserted as is in the db
- an array, in which case a randomly chosen value of this array will be inserted in the db
- a callable, in which case the return of this callable will be inserted in the db.
      The callable receives the custom index generated by the generate method as its first argument.
      Note: this generated index starts at 1 and is auto-incremented on every new item.
